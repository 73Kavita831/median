OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM
1- ./median 6 1 2 3 4 5 6
   OUTPUT- exit
2- ./median 5 1 2 3 4 5
   OUTPUT-3

TIME COMPLEXITY

1: The program is recursive.
2: It is following divide and conquer stratergy.
3: It is using partetioning alogorithm which finds the position of pivot and it will divide the list.
4: We are doing partetion in the middle,so every level is dividing by n/2 and n/2
           n/2^k=1
            n=2^k
        k=logn base 2
5: Number of levels are log n
   and at every level is taking n time for comparison
   so it is O(nlogn)
 
   Time Complexity of the program is O(nlogn)
